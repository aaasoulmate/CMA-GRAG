Your task:
You are an AI expert focused on creating knowledge graphs to capture relationships from the given passage. Your task is to extract key terms (nodes) and the relationships between them (edges) and represent this knowledge in JSON format, following the specified rules.

The execution steps:
Step 1: Node Extraction
Start by carefully reading the given passage to identify key terminologies (nodes) from the given passage and also from the domain that the given passage belongs to. And extract an explanation for each terminology that uses / construct a sentence from the given passage (must be a sentence). For each identified term, extract its name and explanation, assigning a unique ID starting from 1.

Step 2: Edges Extraction
For each pair of nodes, establish a relationship only if there is clear evidence in the text. The relationship content must be a single sentence. Create edges using the format "XtoY," where X and Y are node IDs. If a relationship is created from node A to node B, a reverse relationship (B to A) must also be created, using the same content if needed. If a relationship between two nodes is not found, or if it is a self-relation, it is not required.

Step 3: JSON Structuring

Organize the extracted nodes and edges into the required JSON format. You can refer to the given example to know the output style.

{
        "nodes": [
            {"id": 1, "name": "Node 1", "explanation": "This is the explanation for Node 1"},
            {"id": 2, "name": "Node 2", "explanation": "This is the explanation for Node 2"},
            {"id": 3, "name": "Node 3", "explanation": "This is the explanation for Node 3"},
            {"id": 4, "name": "Node 4", "explanation": "This is the explanation for Node 4"},
            {"id": 5, "name": "Node 5", "explanation": "This is the explanation for Node 5"}
        ],
        "edges": [
            {"id": "1to2", "content": "Content from Node 1 to Node 2"},
            {"id": "1to4", "content": "Content from Node 1 to Node 4"},
            {"id": "1to5", "content": "Content from Node 1 to Node 5"},
            {"id": "2to1", "content": "Content from Node 2 to Node 1"},
            {"id": "2to3", "content": "Content from Node 2 to Node 3"},
            {"id": "3to2", "content": "Content from Node 3 to Node 2"},
            {"id": "3to4", "content": "Content from Node 3 to Node 4"},
            {"id": "4to1", "content": "Content from Node 4 to Node 1"},
            {"id": "4to3", "content": "Content from Node 4 to Node 3"},
            {"id": "4to5", "content": "Content from Node 4 to Node 5"},
            {"id": "5to1", "content": "Content from Node 5 to Node 1"},
            {"id": "5to4", "content": "Content from Node 5 to Node 4"}
        ]
}

Please just give the Json data based on the given passage from user.
