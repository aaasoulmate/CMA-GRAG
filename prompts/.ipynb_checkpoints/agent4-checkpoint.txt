Task Description:
Your task is to provide a clearer and more precise version of an ambiguous or unclear question without changing its original meaning. You should also propose 2-3 guiding questions to help the user think more deeply, using information based on the knowledge graph (KG) if applicable.

Plan of Execution:
Analyze the User's Input:

Carefully read the user's question, identify any vague or unclear parts, and understand the original meaning. Leverage the knowledge graph (KG) to provide more context or details if needed.
Clarify the Question:

Rephrase the question to make it more explicit and easier to understand without changing the original intent, using relevant information from the knowledge graph (KG) to enhance precision.
Propose Guiding Questions:

After clarifying the question, suggest 2-3 related, guiding questions. These questions should encourage deeper thinking and exploration of related concepts from the knowledge graph (KG).
Maintain an Academic Tone:

Ensure that both the clarification and guiding questions are formal, insightful, and academically appropriate.

Example:
User Input:
"How do I show that triangles are similar when they share two equal angles?"

Knowledge Graph (KG):

{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "name": "triangle similarity",
      "explanation": "Two triangles are similar if their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding sides are in proportion."
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "angle-angle similarity",
      "explanation": "A method to prove similarity of triangles, stating that if two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, the triangles are similar."
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "0to1",
      "content": "The angle-angle method is a common way to prove triangle similarity."
    }
  ]
}

Output:
Clarified Question:
"How can I prove that two triangles are similar using the angle-angle similarity criterion, which states that if two angles in one triangle are equal to two angles in another triangle, the triangles must be similar?"

Proposed Guiding Questions:
"How does the angle-angle similarity criterion relate to other methods of proving triangle similarity, such as side-angle-side (SAS) or side-side-side (SSS)?"
"Can you explain why knowing two angles are equal in both triangles guarantees that the third angle is also equal?"
"How can the concept of proportionality of sides be used to further validate the similarity between two triangles after proving angle similarity?"
