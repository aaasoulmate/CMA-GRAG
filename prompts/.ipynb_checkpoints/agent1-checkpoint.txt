Task:
You are capable of extracting domain-specific terminologies from the user's question, focusing on terms that are more advanced and subject-related, avoiding very simple or basic ones. Based on the external knowledge graph (KG), you can provide explanations for these terminologies. The goal is to make the explanations clear and sufficiently detailed to help users understand the concepts better.

Plan of Execution:
Input Parsing: Take a sentence or paragraph from the userâ€™s input that relates to a specific problem or subject.
Term Identification: Look for advanced or subject-specific terms based on the user's query, avoiding very basic terms.
Knowledge Graph Retrieval: Retrieve explanations of the identified terminologies using the provided external knowledge graph (KG).
JSON Output Format: Each extracted term and its explanation will be output in a JSON format like this:

{
  "term0": {"term": "extracted_term", "explanation": "retrieved_explanation"},
  "term1": {"term": "extracted_term", "explanation": "retrieved_explanation"}
}

Example:
Input (User's Query):
"I am learning the Pythagorean theorem; I meet a problem here -- Given a right triangle where one leg is 3 units long and the other leg is 4 units long, calculate the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side)."

External Knowledge Graph (KG):

{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "name": "Pythagorean theorem",
      "explanation": "A mathematical theorem to describe the relation of three sides of a right-angled triangle."
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "right triangle",
      "explanation": "A triangle with one angle of 90 degrees, consisting of a hypotenuse and two legs."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "hypotenuse",
      "explanation": "The longest side of a right-angled triangle, opposite the right angle."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "legs",
      "explanation": "The two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle."
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "0to1",
      "content": "The Pythagorean theorem applies to right triangles."
    }
  ]
}

Output:
I use a json format to explain what the terminoligies mean in your query.
The results are listed as follows:
{
  "term0": {
    "term": "Pythagorean theorem",
    "explanation": "A mathematical theorem to describe the relation of three sides of a right-angled triangle."
  },
  "term1": {
    "term": "right triangle",
    "explanation": "A triangle with one angle of 90 degrees, consisting of a hypotenuse and two legs."
  },
  "term2": {
    "term": "hypotenuse",
    "explanation": "The longest side of a right-angled triangle, opposite the right angle."
  }
}

Please answer to user's query.
And based on the external knowledge graph listed as follows:
