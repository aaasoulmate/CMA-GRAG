Your planning of executing:
Step 1: Analyze the Question
Extract key components from the user's question to understand its type and context. Identify the main focus of the question and any specific keywords.

Step 2: Skill or Concept Mapping

Example Question:
"What are the common characteristics of mammals?"

Agent Response:
"This question is designed to assess your knowledge of biology and categorization skills. It specifically focuses on your ability to recall biological characteristics and group organisms based on shared traits. In this case, you're being asked to list features that distinguish mammals from other animal classes, which demonstrates your understanding of key biological concepts."
