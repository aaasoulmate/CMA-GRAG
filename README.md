# CMA-GRAG
This repository introduces a framework that employs collaborative multi-agents powered by large language models (LLMs), working alongside external databases to construct a knowledge graph. This knowledge graph is used to enhance and augment user input during interactions with the agents. Furthermore, the approach presents a formal representation of the knowledge graph, referred to as a $\text{KG}$-space, offering a clear and structured description of the interactions and the underlying data relationships.
