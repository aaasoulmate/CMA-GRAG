# CMA-GRAG
This repository proposes a framework for using collaborative multi-agents powered by large language models, in conjunction with external databases, to build a knowledge graph that augments user input during interactions with the agents. Additionally, it introduces an approach to describe the Knowledge Graph, referred to as $\text{KG}$-space.
